# welcome here ðŸ‘‹, i'm X.

`ðŸ’»` I'm a fullstack software developer and systems engineer having a blast at programming since `2014`.  
`ðŸ“š` I'm also a student @ [42](https://42angouleme.fr) as well as a freelancer. 

## Why is your profile empty?

If you're searching for my repositories and personal projects, you should check out [my **Codeberg** account](https://codeberg.org/xtrm) where I've migrated everything.  

[**Codeberg**](https://codeberg.org/about) is a **Git** hosting provider, similar to GitLab or BitBucket, but one I **respect**, who respects me back, and from which I fully embrace the philosophy; it's simply the **better** choice for me, both in terms of ethics, respect for **user-privacy**, and functionnality.

Alternatively, you can check out my blog posts (and portfolio _(once it's done)_) on [my **website**](https://xtrm.me).

## What about contributions on other GitHub projects?

I plan to keep contributing to projects no matter the platform. For GitHub, you can find all my forks and contributions in [this dedicated organization](https://github.com/x-random-forks), or in my activity tab.

## "Can I fork/reupload your projects on GitHub?"

I appreciate the thought, but I'd prefer you didn't; see the following articles on [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) and [this plead to developers](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/) not to upload their code on GitHub.
