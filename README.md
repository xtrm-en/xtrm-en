# Heya 👋 I'm `killian.`

`💻` I'm an `18` y/o software developer/engineer enjoying programming since `2014`.  
`📚` I'm a student since `2023` @ [42Angouleme](https://42angouleme.fr), which is a campus part of the [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/). 

`✍️` I enjoy working closely with JVM languages such as [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), as well as other native languages, with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) being my top choice.  
`✨` I develop multiple category of software, usually under my preferred free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS) philosophy.

`🌐` I'm currently working at [Paladium Group](https://paladium-pvp.fr) and at [Auraside](https://github.com/Auraside) on undisclosed projects, as well as contributing to open-source projects and organizations such as [Polyfrost](https://github.com/Polyfrost) and [RedstoneTools](https://github.com/RedstoneTools).  
`🌱` I'm also making in my free time a JVM runtime & injection-based) [modding platform](https://github.com/SpruceLoader), as well as a [bytecode transformation library](https://github.com/stardust-enterprises/deface), altough _very much_ WIPs.
