# welcome here 👋, i'm X.

`💻` I'm a `19` y/o software developer having a blast at programming since `2014`.  
`📚` I'm also a student @ [42 Angouleme](https://42angouleme.fr), a campus part of the wider [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/). 

## Why is your profile empty?

If you're searching for my repositories and personal projects, you should check out [my **Codeberg** account](https://codeberg.org/xtrm) where I've migrated everything.

[**Codeberg**](https://codeberg.org/about) is another Git hosting provider, similar to GitLab or BitBucket, but one which I respect and fully embrace the philosophy; it is simply the **better** choice for me, both in terms of ethics, respect for user-privacy, and functionnality.

## What about contributions on other GitHub projects?

I plan to keep contributing to projects no matter the platform. For GitHub, you can find all my forks and contributions in [this dedicated organization](https://github.com/x-random-forks).

## "Can I fork/reupload your projects on GitHub?"

I appreciate the thought, but I'd prefer you didn't. See the following articles on [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) and [this plead to developers](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/) not to upload their code on GitHub.
