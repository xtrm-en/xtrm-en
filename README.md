# Heya 👋 I'm killian.

I'm a software developer/engineer enjoying programming since 2014. 

I enjoy working closely with JVM languages such as [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org),
as well as other native languages like [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).  
I develop multiple category of software, usually under the
free/libre/open-source (FLOSS) philosophy which I like a lot.

I currently am working on a JVM injection-based [modding platform/framework](https://github.com/stardust-enterprises/atlas-framework), 
as well as a [hooking](https://github.com/MizuSoftware/aspekt)/[transformation framework](https://github.com/stardust-enterprises/deface), 
also for the JVM.
