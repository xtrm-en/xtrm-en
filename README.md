# hi 👋 I'm **killian.**

`💻` I'm an `18` y/o software developer having a blast at programming since `2014`.  
`📚` I'm a student @ [42Angouleme](https://42angouleme.fr), a campus part of the [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/). 

`✨` My projects usually fall under the free/libre/open-source software ([FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) philosophy.
`✍️` I enjoy working closely with JVM languages such as [Java](https://adoptium.net) & [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), as well as [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).  

`🌐` I'm currently working at [Paladium Games](https://paladium-pvp.fr), as well as contributing to multiple open-source projects and organizations.  
`🌱` I'm also making in my free time multiple open-source projects, such as a JVM runtime & injection-based [modding platform](https://github.com/LumosMC), as well as useful [related libraries](https://github.com/stardust-enterprises/deface), altough _very much_ WIPs.
