# Heya 👋 I'm `killian.`

`💻` I'm a software developer/engineer enjoying programming since `2014`.

`✨` I enjoy working closely with JVM languages such as [`Kotlin`](https://kotlinlang.org),
as well as other native languages, with [`Rust`](https://rust-lang.org) being one of my top choices.  
`✍️` I develop multiple category of software, usually under the
free/libre/open-source (FLOSS) philosophy which I like a lot.

`🌱` I currently am working at [`Polyfrost`](https://github.com/Polyfrost) on [`OneConfig`](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfig), a Minecraft configuration library putting emphasis on User Experience.  
I'm also working on a JVM runtime & injection-based [`modding platform`](https://github.com/SpruceLoader), as well as a [`bytecode transformation library`](https://github.com/stardust-enterprises/deface).
